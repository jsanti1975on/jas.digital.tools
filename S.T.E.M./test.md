## Population Growth Visualization with Python

Welcome to the Population Growth Visualization project! 🎉 This is the starting point of an idea designed to showcase population trends in a dynamic and engaging way, combining GIS concepts, data visualization, and Python programming.

The ultimate goal is to build a tool that helps local governments and community planners analyze population growth trends over time, leveraging historical data and modern visualization techniques. This is just the brainstorming phase, and the project will evolve with more features, data, and capabilities.
