# Summary: Key Concepts in Security Functions

Security is an ongoing process that includes assessing needs, setting up security systems, hardening and monitoring them, responding to attacks, and deterring threats. Understanding security fundamentals, compliance factors, and best practice frameworks is critical to contributing effectively to a security team. Below is a summarized overview of key security topics.

## 1. Security Challenges

Modern security faces the following challenges:

### **Key Challenges:**
| **Challenge**                  | **Description**                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sophisticated Attacks**      | Complex and varied, making detection and mitigation difficult.                                      |
| **Proliferation of Tools**     | Easy availability of attack tools online enables even less-skilled attackers to cause harm.         |
| **Attack Scale and Velocity**  | Attacks can spread quickly to millions of systems due to automation and lack of user intervention.  |

## 2. Security Control Types

### **Goals of Security Controls:**
1. **Confidentiality:** Ensures data is not accessed by unauthorized users.
2. **Integrity:** Protects data from unauthorized modification.
3. **Availability:** Keeps data accessible when needed.

### **Types of Controls:**
1. **Implementation-Based:**
   - **Managerial Controls:** Policies, oversight.
   - **Operational Controls:** Human-centered processes.
   - **Technical Controls:** System-based (e.g., firewalls, encryption).
   - **Physical Controls:** Alarms, locks, cameras.
2. **Function-Based:**
   - **Preventive Controls:** Block attacks before they occur.
   - **Detective Controls:** Identify attacks in progress.
   - **Corrective Controls:** Mitigate damage after an attack.
3. **Additional Controls:**
   - Policies, training, and legal or regulatory compliance.
   - Deterrent controls to discourage attackers.

## 3. Security Roles and Responsibilities

### **Typical Security Role Activities:**
- Conduct risk assessments and system testing.
- Specify, source, and configure secure software and devices.
- Set up access controls and user privilege profiles.
- Monitor audit logs and manage incident responses.
- Create and test disaster recovery and business continuity plans.
- Provide security training and education.

### **Key Organizational Units:**
1. **Security Operations Center (SOC):**
   - Monitors and protects critical information assets.
   - Provides rapid incident detection and response.
2. **Development and Operations (DevOps) & DevSecOps:**
   - Encourages collaboration between developers, IT, and security teams.
   - Embeds security (DevSecOps) into every stage of software development ("shift left").
3. **Incident Response Teams (CIRT/CSIRT/CERT):**
   - A single point of contact for handling and reporting security incidents.
   - May function independently or under the SOC.

## 4. The Role of Automation
- Increased use of automation in cloud computing and security operations.
- Security tools and processes are automated through software (DevSecOps principles).
- Enhances detection, monitoring, and response efficiency.

## Conclusion

Security is a multidisciplinary and continuous process involving various controls, roles, and strategies. Collaboration, automation, and embedding security into all organizational processes are essential to mitigate evolving threats effectively.
