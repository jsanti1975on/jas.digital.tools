# Challenges Security Professionals Face

**"Network operations and cloud computing make ever-increasing use of automation through software code."**  
Traditionally, software code has been the responsibility of a programming or development team. However, the separation of development and operations departments or teams can create **silos**, where each team does not collaborate effectively with the other.  

These silos pose significant challenges for security professionals, including:

1. **Lack of Coordination**: Misalignment between development and operations can result in vulnerabilities being overlooked during deployment.
2. **Inefficiency**: Isolated teams often duplicate efforts or fail to address critical issues promptly.
3. **Delayed Responses**: Without seamless communication, incident response times can be significantly slowed.
4. **Increased Risk**: Disconnected workflows can lead to misconfigurations, exposing systems to threats.

### Breaking Down Silos
The adoption of collaborative practices, such as **DevOps** and **DevSecOps**, is essential for overcoming these challenges. These methodologies encourage:
- **Shared Responsibility**: Development, security, and operations teams work together toward common goals.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating the process reduces errors and increases speed.
- **Enhanced Security Posture**: Teams proactively address vulnerabilities as part of the development lifecycle.

As network operations and cloud computing continue to evolve, security professionals must prioritize breaking down silos to improve efficiency and reduce risks.
