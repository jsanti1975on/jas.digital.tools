# CompTIA Security+ Study Notes: Side-Channel Attacks

In this section, we discuss **side-channel attacks**, which involve exploiting physical properties of cryptographic systems (such as power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or timing) to compromise the security of sensitive data. This kind of attack targets the hardware and environment where cryptographic operations take place, not just the cryptographic algorithms themselves.

## Side-Channel Attack Overview

The image below provides a typical setup for side-channel attacks. It demonstrates how attackers can analyze physical signals emitted by hardware during cryptographic operations to extract sensitive information, such as encryption keys or other secrets.

> **Note**: This practical workflow demonstrates how attackers can exploit physical properties (power, EM emissions, or timing) to compromise cryptographic systems. The diagram above highlights the importance of securing not only cryptographic algorithms but also the hardware and environment in which they operate.
