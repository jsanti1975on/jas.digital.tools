# CompTIA Security+ Study Notes: Side-Channel Attacks

In this section, we discuss side-channel attacks, which involve exploiting physical properties of cryptographic systems (such as power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or timing) to compromise the security of sensitive data. This kind of attack targets the hardware and environment where cryptographic operations take place, not just the cryptographic algorithms themselves.

## Side-Channel Attack Overview

The image below provides a typical setup for side-channel attacks. It demonstrates how attackers can analyze physical signals emitted by hardware during cryptographic operations to extract sensitive information, such as encryption keys or other secrets.
