**1.1 - Security Introduction**

- The Security Landscape
    
As a security professional, your role is to stay ahead of potential attackers. Achieve this by adopting a proactive security mindset. Stay updated on the latest threats, familiarize yourself with 

your systems and network, and recognize that there are limits to how much you can secure a network. Beyond those boundaries, it's essential to recognize the signs of an attack and intervene swiftly

to prevent significant damage.

 - Security Concepts

Security involves a continuous balancing act between convenience and protection, so you'll always be exploring ways to reduce risks and threats while ensuring an acceptable level of usability.

By grasping the fundamental concepts of information security, you'll be better equipped to assess the risks to your systems and identify effective strategies for protecting them.

sort => "AAA" refers to "Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting," which is a fundamental security framework that controls access to network resources by verifying user identity, defining what

they can access, and logging their activity on the system; it's a key concept covered in the Security+ exam, signifying the importance of managing user access effectively.

**AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)**

* **Definition:** AAA refers to a fundamental security framework that controls access to network resources. 

* **Components:**
    * **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of a user or device attempting to access a system. 
    * **Authorization:** 
        * Defines the level of access granted to a user or device after successful authentication. 
        * Determines what resources (files, applications, network segments) the user can access and what actions they are permitted to perform. 
        * **Common Authorization Models:**
            * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assigns permissions based on a user's role within the organization (e.g., administrator, manager, employee).
            * **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Grants or denies access based on attributes of the user, the resource, and the environment (e.g., time of day, location).
            * **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):** Allows the owner of a resource to control who can access it.
            * **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):** Restricts access based on security labels and clearances. 
    * **Accounting:** Tracks user activity on the system. This includes recording login/logout times, resources accessed, and actions performed. Accounting data is crucial for auditing, troubleshooting, and identifying potential security threats.

* **Importance in Security+:** 
    * AAA is a core concept within the CompTIA Security+ exam, emphasizing its critical role in securing network resources. 
    * Understanding how to implement and manage effective AAA mechanisms is essential for any security professional.

* **Key Takeaways:**
    * AAA provides a multi-layered approach to access control, enhancing the overall security posture of a system or network.
    * Implementing strong AAA measures is crucial for preventing unauthorized access, detecting malicious activity, and complying with security regulations.
